# Monorepo Starter for Expo (app) and react js (web) with a commonly shared code.

Run `yarn install` in the root directory to install all the dependencies, also run `yarn install` in all the directories in side `packages` i.e. `app`, `web` and `common` to link them correctly.

Run `yarn build:watch` in the packages/common directory and keep it in a separate terminalrunning to monitor the changes in the common directory

Run `yarn build:watch` in the packages/common directory and keep it running to monitor the changes in the `common` directory

`cd packages/common`
`yarn build:watch`

Run `yarn start` in `app` folder and keep it running in a separate terminal to monitor the changes in the `app` directory<br />

Open `http://localhost:19002/` to run the app in respective devices or emulator.

`cd packages/app`
`yarn start`

Run `yarn start` in `web` folder and keep it running in a separate terminal to monitor the changes in the `web` directory.<br />

Open `http://localhost:3000/` to view the web app.

`cd packages/web`
`yarn start`

Now you can add features in `common` and use it in `app` or/and `web`.

Happy code sharing :)
